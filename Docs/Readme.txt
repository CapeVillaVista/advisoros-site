Getadvisoros.ai README File

Site is registered on Go Daddy and we are using custom name servers.

Site is deployed on Cloudflare.

Log into Cloudflare using Google connect option.



A list of deployments
Your production deployment

Step 3: Upload the new file
You have two options:
Option A: Direct Upload (Easiest)

Look for an "Upload" or "Create new deployment" button
Click it and upload your new index.html file
This will automatically replace the old version

Option B: Through the deployment interface

Click on "View details" next to your Production deployment
Look for options to:

"Upload new version"
"Create new deployment"
"Upload assets"


Upload your new index.html

What happens:

Cloudflare Pages automatically replaces the old file with the new one
You don't need to manually delete anything - the new upload overwrites the old
The change is usually live within 1-2 minutes

Alternative: If you can't find the upload button

Go back to the main Workers & Pages screen
Delete the entire project by clicking the three dots (...) menu
Create a new Pages project and upload the new index.html

Note: Cloudflare Pages works on a deployment system - each upload creates a new deployment that automatically replaces the previous one. You don't need to delete files manually.RetryJnow what?EditPerfect! Now you need to create a new deployment with your updated file. Here's what to do:
Click the "Manage deployment" button (top right)
In the dropdown menu, you should see options like:

Create new deployment
Upload new version
Rollback

Select "Create new deployment" or "Upload new version"
This will allow you to:

Upload your new index.html file (the one with the neural network logo)
Cloudflare will automatically replace the current deployment

After uploading:

The new version will deploy in about 1-2 minutes
Your site at https://getadvisoros.ai will automatically update
The old version is kept as a previous deployment (you can rollback if needed)

Alternative: If you don't see these options in the dropdown, look for:

An "Upload" button somewhere on the page
A "New deployment" button
Or go back to the main advisoros project page and look for upload options there

Once you upload the new index.html, your site will have the updated neural network logo!RetryJI am going to delete the project correct?  I dont want to lose my DNS settings though, will I?EditNO, DON'T DELETE THE PROJECT!
You won't lose your DNS settings (they're separate in Cloudflare), but deleting the project means you'll have to:

Create a new Pages project
Re-upload your file
Re-connect your custom domain

Instead, go back and look for:

A "Deployments" tab - where you can create a new deployment
An "Upload" or "+" button somewhere on the project page
A "Create new deployment" option

The interface should allow you to upload a new version without deleting anything.
If you absolutely can't find the upload option:

Go back to the main Workers & Pages section
Look for a "Create application" or "Upload" button there
You might be able to upload directly to your existing project

Your DNS settings are stored separately under the DNS section of your domain, so they're safe either way. But creating a new deployment is much easier than deleting and recreating the entire project!
Can you go back to the main project page and look for deployment or upload options?RetryJI created a new project. you will see it created a few seconds ago.  Site is back and working with new dancing Node.EditExcellent! ðŸŽ‰
I can see your new deployment was created "a few seconds ago" and your site is now live with the new dancing neural network logo!
Your AdvisorOS website at https://getadvisoros.ai now has:

âœ… The neural network logo with animated nodes
âœ… Working Formspree email capture
âœ… Professional AI-themed design
âœ… Consistent branding with your dashboard

Perfect execution! The site should now match your brand identity across all platforms. The animated nodes pulsing in sequence really reinforces that "AI Infrastructure" message.
Is there anything else you'd like to adjust on the site, or are you happy with how it turned out?
